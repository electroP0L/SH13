# SH13
A shool project we worked on - The goal was to code in C a simple connected board game based on the universe of Sherlock Holmes.

To launch our version of the game :
- Get the sh13 repository on your computer.
- Open a terminal window in the repository.
- type "sh cmd.sh"
- then, on the device that you want to use to host the game, type "./server *numport* *IPadress*" to connect the server.
- then, for each player, type "./sh13 *erverIPadress* *servernumport* *playerIPadress* *playernumport*" to connect to the party.
